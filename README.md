# DeepOpLearn
Repository for code for a presentation on Deep Operator Learning / DeepONets at heidelberg University (2023).

## Contents:


### 1. [GRFs for DeepONet - Demo.ipynb](GRFs%20for%20DeepONet%20-%20Demo.ipynb)

Small Julia Notebook that demonstates the Principles of Gaussian Random Fields.

### 2. [DeepONet train DRsystem.ipynb](DeepONet%20train%20DRsystem.ipynb)

Python Notebook in which we train a DeeoONet on a 1D Diffusion-Reaction System.

Requires [DeepXDE](https://github.com/lululxvi/deepxde) v0.11.2 and [DeepONet](https://github.com/lululxvi/deeponet) to be installed locally to function.
